Riak Enterprise is a commercially distributed product built on Riak (Apache 2.0-licensed) that extends Riak's capabilities with [[Masterless multi-site replication|Multi Data Center Replication Concepts]] (Multi Data Center), [[SNMP monitoring|SNMP Configuration]], [[JMX-Monitoring]], and industry-leading support.

There are numerous reasons for multi-site replication.  The increased data locality provided by geographically separated datacenters provides reduced latency and disaster recovery should a datacenter go down.  Spikes in demand can be addressed via global load balancing (cloud bursting).  A cluster could also be used as a fully operational active backup, facilitating the move of another cluster to a new datacenter, or major changes to the cluster such as swapping backends or changing the ring size.
