If you manage your infrastructure with the open source systems integration framework [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/), you'll be happy to know that it is possible to install
Riak with Chef by using the [Riak Chef cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/riak) located in the Opscode cookbook repository.

The cookbook will allow you run a single node, but running a cluster
will require customization of the appropriate configuration files.
